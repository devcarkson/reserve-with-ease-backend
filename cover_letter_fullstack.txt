Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Full-Stack Software Engineer position at [Company Name], as advertised. With over 4 years of experience in developing scalable web applications using Python, Django, React, and modern DevOps tools, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team's success.

In my recent role at Bluedartexpress Logistica, I built a logistics platform handling 10,000+ transactions monthly, integrating RESTful APIs and responsive UIs that improved user engagement by 40%. I deployed the application on AWS with Docker, ensuring 99.9% uptime. My expertise in both frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend (Python, Django) allows me to deliver end-to-end solutions efficiently.

At Sankies Enterprise, I architected backend systems for e-commerce, optimizing APIs for 5,000+ users with sub-200ms response times. I thrive in Agile environments, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver features 20% faster through CI/CD pipelines.

I am passionate about [Company Name]'s mission in [brief company info, e.g., "innovative logistics solutions"], and I would love to bring my skills in full-stack development to help drive your projects forward. I am eager to discuss how my background aligns with your needs.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.

Best regards,

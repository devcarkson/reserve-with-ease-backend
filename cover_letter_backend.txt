Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Backend Developer position at [Company Name]. With 4+ years of experience in Python and Django, specializing in scalable backend architectures and API development, I am eager to bring my expertise to your innovative team.

At Sankies Enterprise, I designed and maintained backend systems for e-commerce platforms using Django and PostgreSQL, serving 5,000+ users with APIs achieving 95% response times under 200ms. I integrated secure authentication with JWT and OAuth2, ensuring data integrity and compliance.

In my work at Bluedartexpress Logistica, I developed RESTful APIs for a logistics application, reducing processing times by 30% and deploying on AWS with Kubernetes for high availability. My proficiency in DevOps tools like Docker and Jenkins has enabled seamless CI/CD pipelines, accelerating feature delivery by 20%.

I am drawn to [Company Name] because of [brief company info, e.g., "your commitment to cutting-edge technology"], and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to backend solutions that scale with your growth. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills in Python, database management, and cloud computing can support your goals.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to [Company Name].

Best regards,

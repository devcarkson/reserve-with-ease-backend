Dear Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to apply for the Python Developer position at [Company Name]. As a seasoned Python specialist with 4+ years of experience in Django, FastAPI, and scalable applications, I am ready to leverage my skills to drive your projects.

At Bluedartexpress Logistica, I engineered a Python-based logistics platform using Django and REST APIs, managing 10,000+ transactions and integrating payment systems that cut processing times by 30%. I utilized Pytest for robust testing and deployed via AWS and Docker for reliability.

My role at Sankies Enterprise involved building backend architectures with Python and PostgreSQL, optimizing for performance and security. I collaborated in Agile teams, delivering features efficiently through GitLab CI/CD.

What excites me about [Company Name] is [brief company info, e.g., "your focus on data-driven solutions"], and I am enthusiastic about contributing my Python expertise to innovative developments. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how I can add value to your team.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am looking forward to potential next steps.

Best regards,
